# Go API Game

## About
This is an attempt at a Go API game.

## How does it work?
Well, to start off with, you need to fork this repository in GitHub.

After this, you will need to make some... changes.

and then submit a Pull Request.

Once that's done, the image should be built and deployed.

and then the game should begin!

## What are the rules?

So, for a successful request you get 10 points, but you get "charged" 5 points every minute.

The game gets harder as time goes on.
